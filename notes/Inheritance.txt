Inheritance
class:
interface


single,multi level, hirarchy, hybrid

derivedClass extends baseClass
derivedinterface extends baseinterface

derivedClass implements baseinterface

virtual feature not offered in class

java class is virtual
try to avoid ambiguity btw thw classes
hirarchy inheritance- 


overloading:
	happens in same class
overriding:
	happen only when inheritance is done happens btw the class
if local tostring is there it never looks for the parent
if there is no local to string then it looks for the class

abstract
public void viewAll()//abstarct method gives error that should not have a body
default void listAll()//no error

 using public modifier we can create a non abstract methods
we cant create abstract method in a class even though we are using abstract keyword
in inheritance we can create a abstract method

static
default

interface we dont have a constructor.
we cant create a object with interface we need to implement it.
